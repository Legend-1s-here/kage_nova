# AGENTS.md — Project Rules for AI Coding Agents
# Read by Antigravity (v1.20.3+), Cursor, and Claude Code.
# Antigravity-only overrides go in GEMINI.md, not here.

## Project Overview
- **Name:** KAGENOVA
- **Type:** Full-stack Web App
- **Stage:** Prototype (Greenfield MVP)

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router) + Tailwind CSS
- **Database:** MongoDB (Atlas free tier) via Mongoose
- **Testing:** Jest + React Testing Library (or Vitest)
- **Package manager:** npm (using npm.cmd on Windows)
- **Commands:** `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`

## Non-negotiables
1. Never report a task as done without having actually run it (tests, build,
   dev server) and observed the result. "This should work" is not done.
2. Never weaken a test, disable a lint rule, or widen a type to make
   something pass. Fix the cause or flag it as a blocker and stop.
3. Never touch code outside the stated scope of the current task. If a fix
   requires touching something out of scope, stop and say so — don't expand
   the blast radius unilaterally.
4. Any new external dependency, new architectural pattern, or change to a
   public API/interface requires an ADR (see `docs/adr/0000-template.md`)
   before implementation, not after.
5. For anything destructive or hard to reverse (schema migrations,
   deployments, deleting data, force-pushing, rotating credentials): stop and
   get explicit human confirmation before acting.
6. Keep `.agents/memory/active-context.md` current and `.antigravityignore`
   up to date as the project grows — see `.agents/workflows/session-protocol.md`
   and `.agents/rules/context-and-tokens.md`.

## Forbidden areas
- Never commit `.env` or `.env.local` containing actual credentials (`MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`).
- Never store group access keys in plaintext — bcrypt hash only.
- Never bypass server-side verification in `/api/groups/[slug]/codes`.
- Generated code or build directories (`.next/`, `node_modules/`, `coverage/`).

## Workflow pointers
- **First time in this repo → follow `.agents/workflows/bootstrap.md`.**
  Fills in every `TODO` below by inspecting the repo and asking plain
  questions — don't hand-fill these files from a blank page.
- Start / end of every session → `.agents/workflows/session-protocol.md`
- New feature → follow `.agents/workflows/new-feature.md`
- Bug fix → follow `.agents/workflows/bug-fix.md`
- Domain rules → `.agents/rules/architecture.md`, `code-quality.md`,
  `testing.md`, `security.md`, `context-and-tokens.md`
- Optional companion tools (Ponytail, Graphify, Agent Skills) →
  `.agents/rules/external-tools.md`
- Project memory (current state, not fixed rules) → `.agents/memory/`
- Unfamiliar term in any of these files → `docs/glossary.md`

## Git conventions
- Conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`,
  `docs:`).
- Keep PRs to one logical change. If a task naturally splits into unrelated
  changes, say so and propose separate PRs instead of bundling them.

## Project Learnings
<!--
This section starts empty. Every time you (the agent) get corrected on
something project-specific — a convention, a gotcha, a "we don't do it that
way here" — add ONE line here yourself, in your own words, dated. This is
what stops the same mistake from happening twice. Do not let this section
be edited only by humans; it's most useful when the agent maintains it.

- 2026-09-25: On Windows PowerShell environments where script execution policy restricts .ps1, always execute npm and npx commands using `npm.cmd` and `npx.cmd`.
